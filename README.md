Project Title: Digital Library Organizer

Project Purpose:
This project demonstrates the use of fundamental data structures and concepts in PHP:
1. Recursion – to display hierarchical library folders and book categories.
2. Hash Tables (Associative Arrays) – to store and retrieve detailed book information efficiently.
3. Binary Search Trees (BST) – to organize and search book titles alphabetically.

How to Run Each Part:
1. Save all PHP files (recursion.php, hashtable.php, bst.php, and main.php) in the same folder.
2. Open your local server (XAMPP, WAMP, or similar).
3. Place the folder in your htdocs directory.
4. Run each file separately by visiting:
   - http://localhost/library/recursion.php
   - http://localhost/library/hashtable.php
   - http://localhost/library/bst.php
5. To view the integrated version, open:
   - http://localhost/library/main.php
